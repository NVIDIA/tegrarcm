.IX tegrarcm
.SH NAME
tegrarcm \- tegra firmware download utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tegrarcm
[
.I options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program is used to send code to a Tegra device in recovery mode.
It does not supported locked devices with an encrypted boot key, only
open devices such as the ventana or cardhu reference boards.  It is
not capable of flashing firmware to a device, but can be used to
download firmware that is then capable of flashing.  For example in
ChromeOS tegrarcm is used to download a special build of u-boot to the
target Tegra device with a payload that it then flashes to the boot
device.

.SS How to use
.IP \(em
Connect a USB cable from your development system to your Tegra
device.  You will either need a USB A to A cable or A to micro B
depending on the target board.
.IP \(em
Find the appropriate BCT file for your board.  For reference boards,
BCT files can be found in the L4T distribution from NVIDIA.
.IP \(em
Build some firmware for your device (such as u-boot)
.IP \(em
Run tegrarcm to download the firmware

.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.B readbct
Read the BCT from the target device and write it to \fIbctfile\fP.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-bct \fIbctfile\fP
Specify the BCT file to download to the Tegra device.  This file contains
memory configuation information for the board.  BCT files can be
obtained through the NVIDIA L4T distribution or generated with
cbootimage and a proper configuration file.
.TP
.B \-\-bootloader \fIblfile\fP
Specify the bootloader file to download to the Tegra device.  This is
the firmware file that will be downloaded and executed.
.TP
.B \-\-loadaddr \fIloadaddr\fP
Specify the address the bootloader will be loaded at.  This should be
specified in hex and is typically 0x108000 for a Tegra20 device or
0x80108000 for a Tegra30, Tegra114, or Tegra124 device.
.TP
.B \-\-entryaddr \fIentryaddr\fP
Specify the entry address that control will be passed to after the
firmware is loaded.  This should be specified in hex.  If this option
is omitted it is assumed to be the same as the load address.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Print the version number and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-help
Print help text and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-miniloader \fImlfile\fP
Read the miniloader from the specified file instead of using the
built-in one.
.TP
.B \-\-miniloader_entry \fImlentry\fP
Specify the entry address of the miniloader.
.TP
.B \-\-usb\-port\-path \fIpath\fP
Specify the physical USB port path of the Tegra device to control.

.SH USB PORT PATH

By default, tegrarcm operates on the first USB applicable device it finds.
In a system that contains multiple Tegra devices, the user may wish to
specify which device tegrarcm should operate upon. The \-\-usb\-port\-path
option allows this, and in a manner that is most immune to the set of attached
USB devices varying.

Note that the USB port path is associated with a physical USB port on a
particular hub. This value will vary if you physically re-organize your USB
connections. This feature is still useful even if your USB topology changes,
providing you have some other mechanism to differentiate attached devices. For
example, you could use a wrapper script around tegrarcm that identifies the
appropriate device by other means, then automatically calculates the USB port
path using the procedures below, and passes the value to tegrarcm.

To determine the USB port path of a device, you must plug it in and find the
current USB bus and USB device number of the device, then map that to the USB
port path. Simply run lsusb to find the current USB bus and device number. If
you have multiple NVIDIA devices attached, you may need to unplug and replug
the Tegra device to ensure you know which is which (all while not changing the
state of any other USB devices so you don't confuse yourself).

.nf
$ lsusb
...
Bus 003 Device 039: ID 0955:7721 NVidia Corp.
Bus 003 Device 045: ID 0955:7140 NVidia Corp.
...
fi

Then, to determine the USB port path, do one of:

.IP 1.

Execute udevmadm on the USB device, and look for the DEVPATH entry. The
final component in the path is the USB port path:

.nf
$ udevadm info /dev/bus/usb/003/045
P: /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb3/3-10/3-10.4
N: bus/usb/003/045
E: BUSNUM=003
E: DEVNUM=045
E: DEVPATH=/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb3/3-10/3-10.4
.fi

.IP 2.

Look at all the sub-directories of /sys/bus/usb/devices/* that do not
contain either ":" or "usb". Each of these will contain a busnum and
devnum file. Find the directory which matches the lsusb output, and use
its name:

.nf
$ cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/3-10.4/busnum
3
$ cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/3-10.4/devnum
45
.fi

Alternatively, you may already have udev rules that create a device node
symlink for the device (after some specific identification algorithm). In
that case, you can search the udev output for MAJOR/MINOR values, or
/sys/bus/usb/devices/* directories for "dev" files, that match the device
node the symlink points to.

Once the port path is known, this value will not vary unless your USB
connections are physically changed, so you can use it over and over
without repeating the steps above.

.SH EXAMPLES
