Introduction
============

This program is used to send code to a Tegra device in recovery mode.
It does not supported locked devices with an encrypted boot key, only
open devices such as the ventana, cardhu, or dalmore reference boards.
It is not capable of flashing firmware to a device, but can be used to
download firmware that is then capable of flashing.  For example in
ChromeOS tegrarcm is used to download a special build of u-boot to the
target Tegra device with a payload that it then flashes to the boot
device.

Platforms supported:
-Tegra20
-Tegra30
-Tegra114

Usage
=====

- Connect a USB cable from your development system to your Tegra
device.  You will either need a USB A to A cable or A to micro B
depending on the target board.
- Find the appropriate BCT file for your board.  For reference boards,
BCT files can be found in the L4T distribution from NVIDIA.
- Build some firmware for your device (such as u-boot)
- Run tegrarcm to download the firmware

Example to download u-boot firmware to a Tegra20 seaboard:

$ sudo tegrarcm --bct seaboard.bct --bootloader u-boot.bin --loadaddr 0x108000
bct file: seaboard.bct
booloader file: u-boot.bin
load addr 0x108000
entry addr 0x108000

Submitting Changes
==================

To submit patches to this project, please use the following commands:

* git format-patch --subject-prefix="tegrarcm PATCH"

  Creates a patch file from your git commit.

* git send-email --to linux-tegra@vger.kernel.org *.patch

  Sends the patch by email to the Tegra mailing list.

Even though the primary upstream repository for this project is hosted on
github, contributions aren't accepted via github pull requests. Github pull
requests would bypass public code review on the project mailing list.

Patches should be signed off (include a signed-off-by line) to indicate your
acceptance of the code's license (see COPYING and the license header in each
file). See http://developercertificate.org/ for details of what signed-off-by
implies.
